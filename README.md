# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project: 

#### Louise, an up and coming playwright, would like to set up a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play "Fever". The purpose of this project was to analyze Kickstarter data for Louise in order to help her to understand how previous kickstarter fundraising campagins have performed. Louise had anticipated a budget of $10,000 for her campaign. I approached this analysis by taking a look at the performance as it related to launch date along with funding goal.

## Analysis and Challenges:

#### The chart above can be used as a visualization of outcomes for the theater category specifically broken out by month.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results:

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
-- May was the most successful month to launch a Kickstarter campaign within the theater category.
-- December saw the fewest successful campaigns.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?




Recommend that Louise consider reducing her goal for her campaigns as a result of our detailed analysis within the attached report.
